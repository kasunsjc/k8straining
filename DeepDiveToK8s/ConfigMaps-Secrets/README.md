# Kubernetes ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps in Kubernetes are used to store non-sensitive configuration data that can be consumed by applications running in pods. They provide a way to decouple configuration from application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations without redeploying the application.

## Creating a ConfigMap

To create a ConfigMap, you can define it in a manifest file using the following syntax:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
```

In this example, we create a ConfigMap named `my-configmap` with two key-value pairs: `key1` and `key2`.

## Mounting ConfigMaps in a Pod

There are different ways to mount ConfigMaps into a pod:

1. Environment Variables: You can set environment variables in a pod's container using the ConfigMap data. For example:

```yaml
env:
  - name: KEY1
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-configmap
        key: key1
```

2. Volume Mounts: You can mount a ConfigMap as a volume in a pod's container. This allows you to access the ConfigMap data as files. For example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-configmap

containers:
  - name: my-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: config-volume
        mountPath: /etc/config
```

In this example, the ConfigMap `my-configmap` is mounted as a volume named `config-volume` in the container. The ConfigMap data can be accessed as files in the `/etc/config` directory.

## Use Cases and Best Practices

ConfigMaps are commonly used for the following scenarios:

- Storing application configuration parameters.
- Providing environment-specific configurations.
- Sharing configuration data across multiple pods.

Here are some best practices when working with ConfigMaps:

- Use descriptive names for ConfigMaps to make them easily identifiable.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in ConfigMaps. Use Secrets for sensitive data.
- Regularly update ConfigMaps as configuration requirements change.
- Use labels and annotations to organize and manage ConfigMaps.
